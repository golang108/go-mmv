## Usage
```bash
mmv file ...
```
This command opens the editor with the list of file names so edit and write.
The command finds the changed lines and renames all the corresponding files.

## Installation
### Homebrew
```sh
brew install itchyny/tap/mmv
```

### Build from source
```bash
go get github.com/itchyny/mmv/cmd/mmv
```

## Features
- `mmv` is implemented in Go language and completely portable.
- `mmv` is designed to be simple as `mv`. It requires no configuration file.
- `mmv` supports renaming in cycle (`mv a b`, `mv b c` and `mv c a` at the same time).
- `mmv` creates destination directories automatically. You can arrange pictures like `yyyy-mm-dd xxxx.jpg` to `yyyy/mm/dd/xxxx.jpg`.
- `mmv` is capable to use as a library (just call `mmv.Rename`).
- `mmv` is easy to remember (I believe), **m**ulti-**mv**.
